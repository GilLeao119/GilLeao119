<h1 align="center">Hello, I'm Gil!</h1>

### Who am I?

I'm a passionate and dedicated software developer focused on building robust and scalable applications that solve real-world problems.

### What do I do?

I'm currently pursuing a degree in Informatics Engineering. Alongside my academic journey, I work on developing practical and innovative solutions using modern technologies and frameworks.

### When do I do that?

In both academic, work and personal projects, I continuously seek opportunities to improve my technical skills. I'm particularly interested in software architecture, full-stack development, and automation.  

### What are my projects?

Most of my work revolves around personal and academic projects. Some are private due to ongoing development or confidential work, but I regularly share complete or near-complete repositories on GitHub.
