<h1 align="center">Hello, I'm Gil!</h1>

### Who am I?

I am a developer who enjoys creating apps and solutions for random challenges.

### What do I do?

Currently I'm getting my degree on Informatic Engeneering, and in my free time, I enjoy developing solutions for problems that I come across.

### When do I do that?

Whenever I have some free time, I love diving into different projects and playing around with various technologies and frameworks.  
The thing is, I tend to start a bunch of random stuff but rarely finish them.  
Still, I find it exciting to learn new things while working on these projects.

### What are my projects?

I mostly work on personal projects that I donâ€™t make public.  
However, the ones I do release are usually at least (almost) complete.

You can check my repositories [here](https://github.com/GilLeao119?tab=repositories).
